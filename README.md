# EntityGateCore
EntityGateCore is an open source .NET library to easily use Entity Framework Core in your applications.

This micro-framework allows you to use objects managed by Entity Framework Core without worrying about the context.

# Is EntityGateCore for me?
Although EntityGateCore can be used by all, it exists specifically to offer additional scenarios to the Entity Framework.

- You want to use the Entity Framework Core and all its tools.
- You want to serialize an Entity (with its modifications).
- You prefer to work from an object point of view without worrying about the context.
- You want to manage an Entity without knowing its context.
- You want to manage a context without knowing the entity to handle.
- You are not familiar with the concept of context.
- Your application is not context-oriented.
- You want a manipulation of the entities and their contexts more transparent to you.

__If one or more scenarios answer your request, this library might interest you.__
